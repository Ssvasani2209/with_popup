Part 29 Jquery Change event (Regarding input element change(type =input,radio,checkbox))
If we want to access all element of the page means (type=input,radio,CHeckbox,Dropdown(Select),Textarea)
then we need to assign the common class to everyone and using that class we can access all element of the page.

Part 30 : Jquery Mouse Events  (Video is regarding display help text when the mouse is over to the help image icon and hide the text when mouse is out to the text)
add 2 div for that.1st div for image display and another is for display text when mouseOver to the image , but imp is to we need to set style initially as none bcz we want to 
display text only when we Mouseover to the text. 
important point to keep in ind is that id attribute value of both these div element is gives the id like for Img set id to ImgFirstname and in 2 nd TD set id to DivFirstName bcz we want to access all id at a time  so its easy to replace value in jquery code.Set these 2 div in all TR.

Jquery code look like :
$(document).ready(function(){
$('img[src="help.png"]').mouseover(function(){     Here we find image only whose src is help.png
var helpIconId=$(this).attr('id');     here we find the id of current image 
var DivId=helpIconId.replace("Img","Div");  after finding image element id we just replace first 3 char which are different in that 2 newly added line
$("#"+DivId).fadein(500);   and from here respected help text is display when mouseOver

}).mouseout(function(){     from here we perform mouseout event
var helpIconId=$(this).attr('id');  here we find the id of current image 
var DivId=helpIconId.replace("Img","Div"); after finding image element id we just replace first 3 char which are different in that 2 newly added line
$("#"+DivId).fadeout(500);  and from here respected help text is hide when mouseOut

});
});

or we can write

$(document).ready(function(){
$('img[src="help.png"]').mouseover(function(){     Here we find image only whose src is help.png
$("#"+getDivId(this)).fadein(500);   and from here respected help text is display when mouseOver

}).mouseout(function(){     from here we perform mouseout event
$("#"+getDivId(this)).fadeout(500);  and from here respected help text is hide when mouseOut

});

function getDivId(helpid)
{
var helpIconId=$(helpid).attr('id');
return helpIconId.replace("Img","Div");
}
});


Note: we can also use mouseenter and mouseleave as well as handlerin and handlerout instead of mouseover and mouseout these all are work as same
